The graduation project is ADAS and consists of 3 systems\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Adaptive Cruise Control
\item Adaptive Light Control
\item Driver Health Care
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Adaptive Cruise Control}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
Adaptive cruise control (ACC) is an enhancement of conventional cruise control. ACC automatically adjusts the speed of your car to match the speed of the car in front of you. If the car ahead slows down, ACC can automatically match it.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Adaptive Light Control}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
Adaptive light control is a system that changes the brightness of the car\textquotesingle{}s headlights automatically based on the environment\textquotesingle{}s light as well as the cars that are coming in the opposite way. The lighter the environment, the darker the headlights.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Driver Health Care}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
Driver health care is a system that is responsible for the detection of the driver\textquotesingle{}s sleepiness and give the suitable alters to warn the driver as well as the other cars in real-\/time using Image Processing and Machine Learning techniques.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Hardware specifications}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
